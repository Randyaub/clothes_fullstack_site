# Clothes store website - In Development

This is a clothing store website where customers are able to browse and purchase clothes. This website was built using the PERN stack.

## Motivation

I decided to start creating a clothing store because I was interested in what goes on behind clothing stores such as Uniqlo and H&M both of which inspired the design of the website.
